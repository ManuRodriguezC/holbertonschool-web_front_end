# Developer tools

The development tools are a set of tools integrated into your web browsers such as chrome, safari, firefox, among others, which allow web developers to know the structure of their pages and be able to manage them through the DOM, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Within these tools we can find:

- Elements
- Sources
- Network
- Performance
- Console
- Memory
- Application
- Security
- Lighthouse
- Recorder

To be able to access the development tools there are different ways, one of these is to right click on any part of the DOM and then click on inspect, there you open the development tools of your web browser.

## Elements
Within the elements panel you can find the tree of DOM elements, in which you will find all the HTML that is on the screen or rendered page, this will allow you to navigate through all the HTML and determine and know the tags and CSS classes that make it up. In addition to this, you will be able to manipulate and edit the DOM by changing its information within the tags or adding, editing or deleting the classes and styles within each one of these.

## Console

The console has two main roles, which are to view logged messages and to execute JavaScript.
Most developers use this tool to be able to find out and ensure that their javascript works correctly, this through javascript functions such as console.log().
But how, let's simulate that a developer is executing a function by clicking on a button, this function saves information in a database, but he cannot be sure that it is arriving, any option to know if it is being executed when clicking is to use a console.log("It is working") within it, if it is executed in console you should see the message "It is working", which will help to understand and assure the developer that it is working the function.

## Sources

Sources allows you to see all the resources or files that are within your web page, there you will find the CSS files, JavaScript, images among others that are needed and used within your page. Apart from that you can add javascript snippets which are little snippets that you can add and run anywhere on your page.

## Network

The network is used mainly to know information about uploads or downloads within your page, these can be of HTTP types when making requests for information within your page to others, there you can observe and obtain the time in calls, the weight of the files or services, the status of your requests, which is very practical when you are going to do any CRUD to another service.

Other tools such as performance allow you to obtain the loading time of your web page, we can also find applications which turns out to be very useful for services created by developers since it allows you to save information within localstorage which is very easy for the user. case of services in which we need a web page to remember data entered by the client or user who is making use of its page.
